# tl;dr

HastyPHP is a small and simple, mostly RESTful API and backend in PHP.

# Why use it?

+ Front-end devs who want a minimalist backend that Backbone and other MV* frameworks work well with.
+ Sometimes you have to use PHP, because clients only have shared hosting, and Python or Ruby would be impossible.
+ You don't want to learn a new gigantic framework, and you want easy deployment.

# Highlights

These are some nice-to-have features that I'll highlight:

+ Allows compatibility for servers not supporting PUT and DELETE methods
+ Uses Bcrypt for password hashing
+ Includes sample Models for Users, Items, ItemTags, and ItemImages
